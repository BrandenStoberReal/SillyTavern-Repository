# SillyTavern Repository

Singular location for all of my [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) projects.

# Foreword Warning

---

I provide no support for the projects in this repository. I can, will, and often do push commits that break
functionality.

If you are boring and don't enjoy fun, I may implement a 'dev' branch in the future for breaking changes and keep 'main'
stable. No promises though.

# Projects

---

[SillyTavern Value Tracker](https://github.com/BrandenStoberReal/SillyTavern-ValueTracker-Plugin) - A NodeJS SillyTavern
plugin designed to track values, monitor changes, and persistently store data in a database.

## Value Tracker Dependants

These projects **will not function** without the above value tracker plugin being installed.

[SillyTavern Outfits Extension](https://github.com/BrandenStoberReal/Extension-SillyTavern-Outfits) - A WebUI extension
designed to track character clothing, allow changing clothing, track the state of clothing, and implement
scenario-specific outfits.

# FAQs

---

**Q:** Why do I need to install a Node.js plugin to use some extensions?! I'm worried you're stealing my cryptocurrency!

**A:** Calm down crypto enthusiast, I do not care about your hawkcoin. While it is true a NodeJS plugin requires system
access, this is the only way to implement a proper persistent database in a performance-friendly manner. I have
attempted to make similar functionality bundled into the extension in the past, but the result was subpar and frankly
terrible. You may inspect the code for the value tracker plugin at any time if you feel concerned.

**Q:** Can you add X language translations?

**A:** No.

---

**Q:** Can you add X feature?

**A:** No.

---

**Q:** Can you make an extension that tracks X?

**A:** No. I do not want to be associated with the strange things you will be tracking.

---

**Q:** Did you use AI for this project?

**A:** Yes. This is an LLM web framework and I really hate Javascript as a language. These projects are silly little QoL
things I wanted to use in SillyTavern and are not representative of myself as a programmer.
